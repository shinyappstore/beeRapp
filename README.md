# beeRapp: Unlock Automated Multivariate Behavioral Data Analysis

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/beeRapp](https://shinyappstore.com/a/beeRapp)__

beeRapp (BEhavioral Explorative analysis R shiny APP) is a specialized application designed for the automated high-throughput explorative analysis of multivariate behavioral data. This tool caters to behavioral scientists by providing an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface that doesn't require programming or data science expertise. beeRapp facilitates clustering, dimensionality reduction, correlational and inferential statistics, producing thousands of standardized and automated output plots. Users may upload a table containing behavioral outcome measures, a table with metadata, and a table with detailed descriptions for automatic labeling of axes on output figures. beeRapp provides several modules for analysis. The clustering module for example allows researchers to identify subgroups within investigated populations using k-means, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), or hierarchical clustering.
